# Sample RabbitMQ receiver.
#
# This creates a fanout exchange named "exchange", binds a queue named
# "exchange.receiver" to it, and prints any content it receives.
#
# This is largely boilerplate for the pika Python AMQP client library;
# see https://pika.readthedocs.org/ for details.  This uses a
# callback-oriented style where we perform an operation like "declare
# an AMQP exchange", and the pika library performs it and calls a
# callback when the server has sent back an acknowledgement.  As such,
# there are many short not obviously connected functions.
#
# https://pika.readthedocs.io/en/0.10.0/examples/asynchronous_consumer_example.html
# is a more involved (and robust) example.

# Python 2 syntax options:
from __future__ import (
    # "import foo" is never in the current directory
    absolute_import,
    # / operator is always floating-point, // is integer
    division,
    # "print" is a built-in function, not a statement
    print_function,
)

# If g = partial(f, param), then g(x) calls f(param, x).  We use this
# to push along the AMQP channel object without stuffing it into a
# global or object.
